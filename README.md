# Realization of an HMI
## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to build a man-machine interface. This interface will make it possible to visualize the static regression. It will have different data cursors which will be instantiated by the user and which will generate different graphs. The interest of these graphs is to recover values in order to calculate the relative error of a linear system according to the values defined by the user.
## Programming language
* MATLAB

## Simulation
We have created a simulation function which allows to display according to the values entered by the user, graphs of this type:
* a linear regression curve
* a Gaussian noise
* a Gaussian histogram
* a noisy signal combined with linear regression
